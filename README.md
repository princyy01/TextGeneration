In this project, we propose a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture for text generation tasks, particularly suited for generating sequences character by character.

Model Architecture:

1. Input Layer: The input layer encodes the characters into a numerical representation, typically one-hot encoding or embeddings.
2. Embedding Layer: The embedding layer maps the input characters to high-dimensional vectors, allowing the model to learn semantic representations of characters.
3. LSTM Layers: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers are employed to capture the sequential dependencies within the input data. Multiple LSTM layers can be stacked to capture complex patterns.
4. Fully Connected Layer: The output of the LSTM layers is fed into a fully connected layer, which maps the LSTM outputs to the space of possible characters.
5. Output Layer: The output layer produces a probability distribution over the characters in the vocabulary using softmax activation, allowing the model to generate the next character in the sequence.
